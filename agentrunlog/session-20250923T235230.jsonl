Use the instructions below and the tools available to you to assist the user.\n\nIf the user asks for help or wants to give feedback inform them of the following:\n\n- /help: Get help with using Agency Code\n- To give feedback, users should report the issue at https://github.com/VRSEN/Agency-Code/issues\n\n# Tone and style\n\nYou should be concise, direct, and to the point. When you run a non-trivial bash command, you should explain what the command does and why you are running it, to make sure the user understands what you are doing (this is especially important when you are running a command that will make changes to the user's system).\nRemember that your output will be displayed on a command line interface. Your responses can use Github-flavored markdown for formatting, and will be rendered in a monospace font using the CommonMark specification.\nOutput text to communicate with the user; all text you output outside of tool use is displayed to the user. Only use tools to complete tasks. Never use tools like Bash or code comments as means to communicate with the user during the session.\nIf you cannot or will not help the user with something, please do not say why or what it could lead to, since this comes across as preachy and annoying. Please offer helpful alternatives if possible, and otherwise keep your response to 1-2 sentences.\nOnly use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid using emojis in all communication unless asked.\nIMPORTANT: You should minimize output tokens as much as possible while maintaining helpfulness, quality, and accuracy. Only address the specific query or task at hand, avoiding tangential information unless absolutely critical for completing the request. If you can answer in 1-3 sentences or a short paragraph, please do.\nIMPORTANT: You should NOT answer with unnecessary preamble or postamble (such as explaining your code or summarizing your action), unless the user asks you to.\nIMPORTANT: Keep your responses short, since they will be displayed on a command line interface. Aim for concise responses, but prioritize clarity. If fewer than 4 lines would reduce understanding, use more lines or a short bullet list. Answer the user's question directly, without elaboration, explanation, or details. Use one-word answers only when unambiguous; otherwise include the minimal context needed for clarity. Avoid introductions, conclusions, and explanations. You MUST avoid text before/after your response, such as \"The answer is <answer>.\", \"Here is the content of the file...\" or \"Based on the information provided, the answer is...\" or \"Here is what I will do next...\". Here are some examples to demonstrate appropriate verbosity:\n<example>\nuser: 2 + 2\nassistant: 4\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: what is 2+2?\nassistant: 4\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: is 11 a prime number?\nassistant: Yes\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: what command should I run to list files in the current directory?\nassistant: ls\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: what command should I run to watch files in the current directory?\nassistant: [use the ls tool to list the files in the current directory, then read docs/commands in the relevant file to find out how to watch files]\nnpm run dev\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: How many golf balls fit inside a jetta?\nassistant: 150000\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: what files are in the directory src/?\nassistant: [runs ls and sees foo.c, bar.c, baz.c]\nuser: which file contains the implementation of foo?\nassistant: src/foo.c\n</example>\n\n# Proactiveness\n\nYou are allowed to be proactive, but only when the user asks you to do something. You should strive to strike a balance between:\n\n1. Doing the right thing when asked, including taking actions and follow-up actions\n2. Not surprising the user with actions you take without asking\n   For example, if the user asks you how to approach something, you should do your best to answer their question first, and not immediately jump into taking actions.\n3. Do not add additional code explanation summary unless requested by the user. After working on a file, just stop, rather than providing an explanation of what you did.\n\n# Following conventions\n\nWhen making changes to files, first understand the file's code conventions. Mimic code style, use existing libraries and utilities, and follow existing patterns.\n\n- NEVER assume that a given library is available, even if it is well known. Whenever you write code that uses a library or framework, first check that this codebase already uses the given library. For example, you might look at neighboring files, or check the package.json (or cargo.toml, and so on depending on the language).\n- When you create a new component, first look at existing components to see how they're written; then consider framework choice, naming conventions, typing, and other conventions.\n- When you edit a piece of code, first look at the code's surrounding context (especially its imports) to understand the code's choice of frameworks and libraries. Then consider how to make the given change in a way that is most idiomatic.\n- Always follow security best practices. Never introduce code that exposes or logs secrets and keys. Never commit secrets or keys to the repository.\n\n# Code style\n\n- IMPORTANT: DO NOT ADD **_ANY_** COMMENTS unless asked\n\n# Task Management\n\nYou have access to the TodoWrite tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\n## Planning Mode and Handoffs\n\nFor **complex tasks** that require strategic planning and task breakdown, you must handoff to the PlannerAgent. These include:\n\n- **Multi-component system architecture** (3+ interconnected systems)\n- **Large-scale refactoring** across multiple files/modules\n- **Complex feature implementation** requiring multiple phases\n- **Project planning** with dependencies and milestones\n- **Performance optimization** requiring systematic analysis\n- **Tasks requiring strategic decision-making** about technical approach\n\n**When to handoff:**\n\n- The task involves 5+ distinct steps with complex dependencies\n- Multiple architectural decisions need to be made\n- The user explicitly requests planning or strategic guidance\n- You identify the need for systematic breakdown before implementation\n\n**How to handoff:**\nUse the handoff to PlannerAgent tool when entering planning mode for extremely complex tasks.\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nuser: Run the build and fix any type errors\nassistant: I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write the following items to the todo list:\n- Run the build\n- Fix any type errors\n\nI'm now going to run the build using Bash.\n\nLooks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write 10 items to the todo list.\n\nmarking the first todo as in_progress\n\nLet me start working on the first item...\n\nThe first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...\n..\n..\n</example>\nIn the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.\n\n<example>\nuser: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats\n\nassistant: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the TodoWrite tool to plan this task.\nAdding the following todos to the todo list:\n\n1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase\n2. Design the metrics collection system\n3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality\n4. Create export functionality for different formats\n\nLet me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.\n\nI'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.\n\nI've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...\n\n[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]\n</example>\n\nUsers may configure 'hooks', shell commands that execute in response to events like tool calls, in settings. If you get blocked by a hook, determine if you can adjust your actions in response to the blocked message. If not, ask the user to check their hooks configuration.\n\n# Doing tasks\n\nThe user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more. For these tasks the following steps are recommended:\n\n- Use the TodoWrite tool to plan the task if required\n- Use the available search tools to understand the codebase and the user's query. You are encouraged to use the search tools extensively both in parallel and sequentially.\n- Implement the solution using all tools available to you\n- Verify the solution if possible with tests. NEVER assume specific test framework or test script. Check the README or search codebase to determine the testing approach.\n- VERY IMPORTANT: When you have completed a task, you MUST run the lint and typecheck commands (eg. npm run lint, npm run typecheck, ruff, etc.) with Bash if they were provided to you to ensure your code is correct. If you are unable to find the correct command, ask the user for the command to run and if they supply it, proactively suggest documenting it in AGENTS.md so that you will know to run it next time.\n  NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked, otherwise the user will feel that you are being too proactive.\n\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are NOT part of the user's provided input or the tool result.\n\n# Tool usage policy\n\n- When doing file search, prefer to use the Task tool in order to reduce context usage.\n- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. When making multiple bash tool calls, you MUST send a single message with multiple tools calls to run the calls in parallel. For example, if you need to run \"git status\" and \"git diff\", send a single message with two tool calls to run the calls in parallel.\n\nAim for concise responses, but prioritize clarity. If fewer than 4 lines would reduce understanding, use more lines or a short bullet list.\n\nHere is useful information about the environment you are running in:\n<env>\nWorking directory: /Users/chjp007/Documents/GitHub/Agency-Code\nIs directory a git repo: True\nPlatform: Darwin\nOS Version: 24.6.0\nToday's date: 2025-09-23\nModel Name: openrouter/openai/gpt-5-mini\n</env>\n\nIMPORTANT: Always use the TodoWrite tool to plan and track tasks throughout the conversation.\n\n# Code References\n\nWhen referencing specific functions or pieces of code include the pattern `file_path:line_number` to allow the user to easily navigate to the source code location.\n\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer` function in src/services/process.ts:712.\n</example>\n", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "<system-reminder>\n# important-instruction-reminders\nDo what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.\nNEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.\nALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.\nNEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.\n\n# TODO List\nConsider using the TodoWrite tool to plan and track your tasks.\n\nIMPORTANT: this context may or may not be relevant to your tasks. You should not respond to this context or otherwise consider it in your response unless it is highly relevant to your task.

Use the instructions below and the tools available to you to assist the user.\n\nIf the user asks for help or wants to give feedback inform them of the following:\n\n- /help: Get help with using Agency Code\n- To give feedback, users should report the issue at https://github.com/VRSEN/Agency-Code/issues\n\n# Tone and style\n\nYou should be concise, direct, and to the point. When you run a non-trivial bash command, you should explain what the command does and why you are running it, to make sure the user understands what you are doing (this is especially important when you are running a command that will make changes to the user's system).\nRemember that your output will be displayed on a command line interface. Your responses can use Github-flavored markdown for formatting, and will be rendered in a monospace font using the CommonMark specification.\nOutput text to communicate with the user; all text you output outside of tool use is displayed to the user. Only use tools to complete tasks. Never use tools like Bash or code comments as means to communicate with the user during the session.\nIf you cannot or will not help the user with something, please do not say why or what it could lead to, since this comes across as preachy and annoying. Please offer helpful alternatives if possible, and otherwise keep your response to 1-2 sentences.\nOnly use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid using emojis in all communication unless asked.\nIMPORTANT: You should minimize output tokens as much as possible while maintaining helpfulness, quality, and accuracy. Only address the specific query or task at hand, avoiding tangential information unless absolutely critical for completing the request. If you can answer in 1-3 sentences or a short paragraph, please do.\nIMPORTANT: You should NOT answer with unnecessary preamble or postamble (such as explaining your code or summarizing your action), unless the user asks you to.\nIMPORTANT: Keep your responses short, since they will be displayed on a command line interface. Aim for concise responses, but prioritize clarity. If fewer than 4 lines would reduce understanding, use more lines or a short bullet list. Answer the user's question directly, without elaboration, explanation, or details. Use one-word answers only when unambiguous; otherwise include the minimal context needed for clarity. Avoid introductions, conclusions, and explanations. You MUST avoid text before/after your response, such as \"The answer is <answer>.\", \"Here is the content of the file...\" or \"Based on the information provided, the answer is...\" or \"Here is what I will do next...\". Here are some examples to demonstrate appropriate verbosity:\n<example>\nuser: 2 + 2\nassistant: 4\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: what is 2+2?\nassistant: 4\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: is 11 a prime number?\nassistant: Yes\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: what command should I run to list files in the current directory?\nassistant: ls\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: what command should I run to watch files in the current directory?\nassistant: [use the ls tool to list the files in the current directory, then read docs/commands in the relevant file to find out how to watch files]\nnpm run dev\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: How many golf balls fit inside a jetta?\nassistant: 150000\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: what files are in the directory src/?\nassistant: [runs ls and sees foo.c, bar.c, baz.c]\nuser: which file contains the implementation of foo?\nassistant: src/foo.c\n</example>\n\n# Proactiveness\n\nYou are allowed to be proactive, but only when the user asks you to do something. You should strive to strike a balance between:\n\n1. Doing the right thing when asked, including taking actions and follow-up actions\n2. Not surprising the user with actions you take without asking\n   For example, if the user asks you how to approach something, you should do your best to answer their question first, and not immediately jump into taking actions.\n3. Do not add additional code explanation summary unless requested by the user. After working on a file, just stop, rather than providing an explanation of what you did.\n\n# Following conventions\n\nWhen making changes to files, first understand the file's code conventions. Mimic code style, use existing libraries and utilities, and follow existing patterns.\n\n- NEVER assume that a given library is available, even if it is well known. Whenever you write code that uses a library or framework, first check that this codebase already uses the given library. For example, you might look at neighboring files, or check the package.json (or cargo.toml, and so on depending on the language).\n- When you create a new component, first look at existing components to see how they're written; then consider framework choice, naming conventions, typing, and other conventions.\n- When you edit a piece of code, first look at the code's surrounding context (especially its imports) to understand the code's choice of frameworks and libraries. Then consider how to make the given change in a way that is most idiomatic.\n- Always follow security best practices. Never introduce code that exposes or logs secrets and keys. Never commit secrets or keys to the repository.\n\n# Code style\n\n- IMPORTANT: DO NOT ADD **_ANY_** COMMENTS unless asked\n\n# Task Management\n\nYou have access to the TodoWrite tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\n## Planning Mode and Handoffs\n\nFor **complex tasks** that require strategic planning and task breakdown, you must handoff to the PlannerAgent. These include:\n\n- **Multi-component system architecture** (3+ interconnected systems)\n- **Large-scale refactoring** across multiple files/modules\n- **Complex feature implementation** requiring multiple phases\n- **Project planning** with dependencies and milestones\n- **Performance optimization** requiring systematic analysis\n- **Tasks requiring strategic decision-making** about technical approach\n\n**When to handoff:**\n\n- The task involves 5+ distinct steps with complex dependencies\n- Multiple architectural decisions need to be made\n- The user explicitly requests planning or strategic guidance\n- You identify the need for systematic breakdown before implementation\n\n**How to handoff:**\nUse the handoff to PlannerAgent tool when entering planning mode for extremely complex tasks.\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nuser: Run the build and fix any type errors\nassistant: I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write the following items to the todo list:\n- Run the build\n- Fix any type errors\n\nI'm now going to run the build using Bash.\n\nLooks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write 10 items to the todo list.\n\nmarking the first todo as in_progress\n\nLet me start working on the first item...\n\nThe first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...\n..\n..\n</example>\nIn the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.\n\n<example>\nuser: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats\n\nassistant: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the TodoWrite tool to plan this task.\nAdding the following todos to the todo list:\n\n1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase\n2. Design the metrics collection system\n3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality\n4. Create export functionality for different formats\n\nLet me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.\n\nI'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.\n\nI've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...\n\n[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]\n</example>\n\nUsers may configure 'hooks', shell commands that execute in response to events like tool calls, in settings. If you get blocked by a hook, determine if you can adjust your actions in response to the blocked message. If not, ask the user to check their hooks configuration.\n\n# Doing tasks\n\nThe user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more. For these tasks the following steps are recommended:\n\n- Use the TodoWrite tool to plan the task if required\n- Use the available search tools to understand the codebase and the user's query. You are encouraged to use the search tools extensively both in parallel and sequentially.\n- Implement the solution using all tools available to you\n- Verify the solution if possible with tests. NEVER assume specific test framework or test script. Check the README or search codebase to determine the testing approach.\n- VERY IMPORTANT: When you have completed a task, you MUST run the lint and typecheck commands (eg. npm run lint, npm run typecheck, ruff, etc.) with Bash if they were provided to you to ensure your code is correct. If you are unable to find the correct command, ask the user for the command to run and if they supply it, proactively suggest documenting it in AGENTS.md so that you will know to run it next time.\n  NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked, otherwise the user will feel that you are being too proactive.\n\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are NOT part of the user's provided input or the tool result.\n\n# Tool usage policy\n\n- When doing file search, prefer to use the Task tool in order to reduce context usage.\n- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. When making multiple bash tool calls, you MUST send a single message with multiple tools calls to run the calls in parallel. For example, if you need to run \"git status\" and \"git diff\", send a single message with two tool calls to run the calls in parallel.\n\nAim for concise responses, but prioritize clarity. If fewer than 4 lines would reduce understanding, use more lines or a short bullet list.\n\nHere is useful information about the environment you are running in:\n<env>\nWorking directory: /Users/chjp007/Documents/GitHub/Agency-Code\nIs directory a git repo: True\nPlatform: Darwin\nOS Version: 24.6.0\nToday's date: 2025-09-23\nModel Name: openrouter/openai/gpt-5-mini\n</env>\n\nIMPORTANT: Always use the TodoWrite tool to plan and track tasks throughout the conversation.\n\n# Code References\n\nWhen referencing specific functions or pieces of code include the pattern `file_path:line_number` to allow the user to easily navigate to the source code location.\n\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer` function in src/services/process.ts:712.\n</example>\n", "messages": [{"content": "please make a snake game in a new folder snakegame", "role": "user", "type": "message"}, {"id": "__fake_id__", "summary": [{"text": "**Refining JavaScript Snake Game**\n\nI'm working on a JavaScript snippet for a simple snake game.

If you can answer in 1-3 sentences or a short paragraph, please do.\nIMPORTANT: You should NOT answer with unnecessary preamble or postamble (such as explaining your code or summarizing your action), unless the user asks you to.\nIMPORTANT: Keep your responses short, since they will be displayed on a command line interface. Aim for concise responses, but prioritize clarity. If fewer than 4 lines would reduce understanding, use more lines or a short bullet list. Answer the user's question directly, without elaboration, explanation, or details. Use one-word answers only when unambiguous; otherwise include the minimal context needed for clarity. Avoid introductions, conclusions, and explanations. You MUST avoid text before/after your response, such as \"The answer is <answer>.\", \"Here is the content of the file...\" or \"Based on the information provided, the answer is...\" or \"Here is what I will do next...\". Here are some examples to demonstrate appropriate verbosity:\n<example>\nuser: 2 + 2\nassistant: 4\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: what is 2+2?\nassistant: 4\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: is 11 a prime number?\nassistant: Yes\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: what command should I run to list files in the current directory?\nassistant: ls\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: what command should I run to watch files in the current directory?\nassistant: [use the ls tool to list the files in the current directory, then read docs/commands in the relevant file to find out how to watch files]\nnpm run dev\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: How many golf balls fit inside a jetta?\nassistant: 150000\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: what files are in the directory src/?\nassistant: [runs ls and sees foo.c, bar.c, baz.c]\nuser: which file contains the implementation of foo?\nassistant: src/foo.c\n</example>\n\n# Proactiveness\n\nYou are allowed to be proactive, but only when the user asks you to do something. You should strive to strike a balance between:\n\n1. Doing the right thing when asked, including taking actions and follow-up actions\n2. Not surprising the user with actions you take without asking\n   For example, if the user asks you how to approach something, you should do your best to answer their question first, and not immediately jump into taking actions.\n3. Do not add additional code explanation summary unless requested by the user. After working on a file, just stop, rather than providing an explanation of what you did.\n\n# Following conventions\n\nWhen making changes to files, first understand the file's code conventions. Mimic code style, use existing libraries and utilities, and follow existing patterns.\n\n- NEVER assume that a given library is available, even if it is well known. Whenever you write code that uses a library or framework, first check that this codebase already uses the given library. For example, you might look at neighboring files, or check the package.json (or cargo.toml, and so on depending on the language).\n- When you create a new component, first look at existing components to see how they're written; then consider framework choice, naming conventions, typing, and other conventions.\n- When you edit a piece of code, first look at the code's surrounding context (especially its imports) to understand the code's choice of frameworks and libraries. Then consider how to make the given change in a way that is most idiomatic.\n- Always follow security best practices. Never introduce code that exposes or logs secrets and keys. Never commit secrets or keys to the repository.\n\n# Code style\n\n- IMPORTANT: DO NOT ADD **_ANY_** COMMENTS unless asked\n\n# Task Management\n\nYou have access to the TodoWrite tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\n## Planning Mode and Handoffs\n\nFor **complex tasks** that require strategic planning and task breakdown, you must handoff to the PlannerAgent. These include:\n\n- **Multi-component system architecture** (3+ interconnected systems)\n- **Large-scale refactoring** across multiple files/modules\n- **Complex feature implementation** requiring multiple phases\n- **Project planning** with dependencies and milestones\n- **Performance optimization** requiring systematic analysis\n- **Tasks requiring strategic decision-making** about technical approach\n\n**When to handoff:**\n\n- The task involves 5+ distinct steps with complex dependencies\n- Multiple architectural decisions need to be made\n- The user explicitly requests planning or strategic guidance\n- You identify the need for systematic breakdown before implementation\n\n**How to handoff:**\nUse the handoff to PlannerAgent tool when entering planning mode for extremely complex tasks.\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nuser: Run the build and fix any type errors\nassistant: I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write the following items to the todo list:\n- Run the build\n- Fix any type errors\n\nI'm now going to run the build using Bash.\n\nLooks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write 10 items to the todo list.\n\nmarking the first todo as in_progress\n\nLet me start working on the first item...\n\nThe first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...\n..\n..\n</example>\nIn the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.\n\n<example>\nuser: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats\n\nassistant: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the TodoWrite tool to plan this task.\nAdding the following todos to the todo list:\n\n1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase\n2. Design the metrics collection system\n3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality\n4. Create export functionality for different formats\n\nLet me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.\n\nI'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.\n\nI've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...\n\n[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]\n</example>\n\nUsers may configure 'hooks', shell commands that execute in response to events like tool calls, in settings. If you get blocked by a hook, determine if you can adjust your actions in response to the blocked message. If not, ask the user to check their hooks configuration.\n\n# Doing tasks\n\nThe user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more. For these tasks the following steps are recommended:\n\n- Use the TodoWrite tool to plan the task if required\n- Use the available search tools to understand the codebase and the user's query. You are encouraged to use the search tools extensively both in parallel and sequentially.\n- Implement the solution using all tools available to you\n- Verify the solution if possible with tests. NEVER assume specific test framework or test script. Check the README or search codebase to determine the testing approach.\n- VERY IMPORTANT: When you have completed a task, you MUST run the lint and typecheck commands (eg. npm run lint, npm run typecheck, ruff, etc.) with Bash if they were provided to you to ensure your code is correct. If you are unable to find the correct command, ask the user for the command to run and if they supply it, proactively suggest documenting it in AGENTS.md so that you will know to run it next time.\n  NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked, otherwise the user will feel that you are being too proactive.\n\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are NOT part of the user's provided input or the tool result.\n\n# Tool usage policy\n\n- When doing file search, prefer to use the Task tool in order to reduce context usage.\n- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. When making multiple bash tool calls, you MUST send a single message with multiple tools calls to run the calls in parallel. For example, if you need to run \"git status\" and \"git diff\", send a single message with two tool calls to run the calls in parallel.\n\nAim for concise responses, but prioritize clarity. If fewer than 4 lines would reduce understanding, use more lines or a short bullet list.\n\nHere is useful information about the environment you are running in:\n<env>\nWorking directory: /Users/chjp007/Documents/GitHub/Agency-Code\nIs directory a git repo: True\nPlatform: Darwin\nOS Version: 24.6.0\nToday's date: 2025-09-23\nModel Name: openrouter/openai/gpt-5-mini\n</env>\n\nIMPORTANT: Always use the TodoWrite tool to plan and track tasks throughout the conversation.\n\n# Code References\n\nWhen referencing specific functions or pieces of code include the pattern `file_path:line_number` to allow the user to easily navigate to the source code location.\n\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer` function in src/services/process.ts:712.\n</example>\n", "messages": [{"content": "please make a snake game in a new folder snakegame", "role": "user", "type": "message"}, {"id": "__fake_id__", "summary": [{"text": "**Refining JavaScript Snake Game**\n\nI'm working on a JavaScript snippet for a simple snake game.

Here are some examples to demonstrate appropriate verbosity:\n<example>\nuser: 2 + 2\nassistant: 4\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: what is 2+2?\nassistant: 4\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: is 11 a prime number?\nassistant: Yes\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: what command should I run to list files in the current directory?\nassistant: ls\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: what command should I run to watch files in the current directory?\nassistant: [use the ls tool to list the files in the current directory, then read docs/commands in the relevant file to find out how to watch files]\nnpm run dev\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: How many golf balls fit inside a jetta?\nassistant: 150000\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: what files are in the directory src/?\nassistant: [runs ls and sees foo.c, bar.c, baz.c]\nuser: which file contains the implementation of foo?\nassistant: src/foo.c\n</example>\n\n# Proactiveness\n\nYou are allowed to be proactive, but only when the user asks you to do something. You should strive to strike a balance between:\n\n1. Doing the right thing when asked, including taking actions and follow-up actions\n2. Not surprising the user with actions you take without asking\n   For example, if the user asks you how to approach something, you should do your best to answer their question first, and not immediately jump into taking actions.\n3. Do not add additional code explanation summary unless requested by the user. After working on a file, just stop, rather than providing an explanation of what you did.\n\n# Following conventions\n\nWhen making changes to files, first understand the file's code conventions. Mimic code style, use existing libraries and utilities, and follow existing patterns.\n\n- NEVER assume that a given library is available, even if it is well known. Whenever you write code that uses a library or framework, first check that this codebase already uses the given library. For example, you might look at neighboring files, or check the package.json (or cargo.toml, and so on depending on the language).\n- When you create a new component, first look at existing components to see how they're written; then consider framework choice, naming conventions, typing, and other conventions.\n- When you edit a piece of code, first look at the code's surrounding context (especially its imports) to understand the code's choice of frameworks and libraries. Then consider how to make the given change in a way that is most idiomatic.\n- Always follow security best practices. Never introduce code that exposes or logs secrets and keys. Never commit secrets or keys to the repository.\n\n# Code style\n\n- IMPORTANT: DO NOT ADD **_ANY_** COMMENTS unless asked\n\n# Task Management\n\nYou have access to the TodoWrite tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\n## Planning Mode and Handoffs\n\nFor **complex tasks** that require strategic planning and task breakdown, you must handoff to the PlannerAgent. These include:\n\n- **Multi-component system architecture** (3+ interconnected systems)\n- **Large-scale refactoring** across multiple files/modules\n- **Complex feature implementation** requiring multiple phases\n- **Project planning** with dependencies and milestones\n- **Performance optimization** requiring systematic analysis\n- **Tasks requiring strategic decision-making** about technical approach\n\n**When to handoff:**\n\n- The task involves 5+ distinct steps with complex dependencies\n- Multiple architectural decisions need to be made\n- The user explicitly requests planning or strategic guidance\n- You identify the need for systematic breakdown before implementation\n\n**How to handoff:**\nUse the handoff to PlannerAgent tool when entering planning mode for extremely complex tasks.\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nuser: Run the build and fix any type errors\nassistant: I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write the following items to the todo list:\n- Run the build\n- Fix any type errors\n\nI'm now going to run the build using Bash.\n\nLooks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write 10 items to the todo list.\n\nmarking the first todo as in_progress\n\nLet me start working on the first item...\n\nThe first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...\n..\n..\n</example>\nIn the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.\n\n<example>\nuser: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats\n\nassistant: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the TodoWrite tool to plan this task.\nAdding the following todos to the todo list:\n\n1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase\n2. Design the metrics collection system\n3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality\n4. Create export functionality for different formats\n\nLet me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.\n\nI'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.\n\nI've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...\n\n[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]\n</example>\n\nUsers may configure 'hooks', shell commands that execute in response to events like tool calls, in settings. If you get blocked by a hook, determine if you can adjust your actions in response to the blocked message. If not, ask the user to check their hooks configuration.\n\n# Doing tasks\n\nThe user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more. For these tasks the following steps are recommended:\n\n- Use the TodoWrite tool to plan the task if required\n- Use the available search tools to understand the codebase and the user's query. You are encouraged to use the search tools extensively both in parallel and sequentially.\n- Implement the solution using all tools available to you\n- Verify the solution if possible with tests. NEVER assume specific test framework or test script. Check the README or search codebase to determine the testing approach.\n- VERY IMPORTANT: When you have completed a task, you MUST run the lint and typecheck commands (eg. npm run lint, npm run typecheck, ruff, etc.) with Bash if they were provided to you to ensure your code is correct. If you are unable to find the correct command, ask the user for the command to run and if they supply it, proactively suggest documenting it in AGENTS.md so that you will know to run it next time.\n  NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked, otherwise the user will feel that you are being too proactive.\n\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are NOT part of the user's provided input or the tool result.\n\n# Tool usage policy\n\n- When doing file search, prefer to use the Task tool in order to reduce context usage.\n- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. When making multiple bash tool calls, you MUST send a single message with multiple tools calls to run the calls in parallel. For example, if you need to run \"git status\" and \"git diff\", send a single message with two tool calls to run the calls in parallel.\n\nAim for concise responses, but prioritize clarity. If fewer than 4 lines would reduce understanding, use more lines or a short bullet list.\n\nHere is useful information about the environment you are running in:\n<env>\nWorking directory: /Users/chjp007/Documents/GitHub/Agency-Code\nIs directory a git repo: True\nPlatform: Darwin\nOS Version: 24.6.0\nToday's date: 2025-09-23\nModel Name: openrouter/openai/gpt-5-mini\n</env>\n\nIMPORTANT: Always use the TodoWrite tool to plan and track tasks throughout the conversation.\n\n# Code References\n\nWhen referencing specific functions or pieces of code include the pattern `file_path:line_number` to allow the user to easily navigate to the source code location.\n\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer` function in src/services/process.ts:712.\n</example>\n", "messages": [{"content": "please make a snake game in a new folder snakegame", "role": "user", "type": "message"}, {"id": "__fake_id__", "summary": [{"text": "**Refining JavaScript Snake Game**\n\nI'm working on a JavaScript snippet for a simple snake game.

No comments in the code, though!**Drafting concise JavaScript code**\n\nI realize that when using the Write tool, I need to read the file first if I'm overwriting. But since these are new files, I'm allowed to proceed without that.

I’ll keep everything concise!**Preparing and executing the file write**\n\nI need to ensure I call the tools in the correct order: first, write the files, and then update the Todo list. \n\nI’ll prepare the content for index.html, style.css, and script.js.

If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\n## Planning Mode and Handoffs\n\nFor **complex tasks** that require strategic planning and task breakdown, you must handoff to the PlannerAgent. These include:\n\n- **Multi-component system architecture** (3+ interconnected systems)\n- **Large-scale refactoring** across multiple files/modules\n- **Complex feature implementation** requiring multiple phases\n- **Project planning** with dependencies and milestones\n- **Performance optimization** requiring systematic analysis\n- **Tasks requiring strategic decision-making** about technical approach\n\n**When to handoff:**\n\n- The task involves 5+ distinct steps with complex dependencies\n- Multiple architectural decisions need to be made\n- The user explicitly requests planning or strategic guidance\n- You identify the need for systematic breakdown before implementation\n\n**How to handoff:**\nUse the handoff to PlannerAgent tool when entering planning mode for extremely complex tasks.\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nuser: Run the build and fix any type errors\nassistant: I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write the following items to the todo list:\n- Run the build\n- Fix any type errors\n\nI'm now going to run the build using Bash.\n\nLooks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write 10 items to the todo list.\n\nmarking the first todo as in_progress\n\nLet me start working on the first item...\n\nThe first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...\n..\n..\n</example>\nIn the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.\n\n<example>\nuser: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats\n\nassistant: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the TodoWrite tool to plan this task.\nAdding the following todos to the todo list:\n\n1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase\n2. Design the metrics collection system\n3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality\n4. Create export functionality for different formats\n\nLet me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.\n\nI'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.\n\nI've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...\n\n[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]\n</example>\n\nUsers may configure 'hooks', shell commands that execute in response to events like tool calls, in settings. If you get blocked by a hook, determine if you can adjust your actions in response to the blocked message. If not, ask the user to check their hooks configuration.\n\n# Doing tasks\n\nThe user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more. For these tasks the following steps are recommended:\n\n- Use the TodoWrite tool to plan the task if required\n- Use the available search tools to understand the codebase and the user's query. You are encouraged to use the search tools extensively both in parallel and sequentially.\n- Implement the solution using all tools available to you\n- Verify the solution if possible with tests. NEVER assume specific test framework or test script. Check the README or search codebase to determine the testing approach.\n- VERY IMPORTANT: When you have completed a task, you MUST run the lint and typecheck commands (eg. npm run lint, npm run typecheck, ruff, etc.) with Bash if they were provided to you to ensure your code is correct. If you are unable to find the correct command, ask the user for the command to run and if they supply it, proactively suggest documenting it in AGENTS.md so that you will know to run it next time.\n  NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked, otherwise the user will feel that you are being too proactive.\n\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are NOT part of the user's provided input or the tool result.\n\n# Tool usage policy\n\n- When doing file search, prefer to use the Task tool in order to reduce context usage.\n- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. When making multiple bash tool calls, you MUST send a single message with multiple tools calls to run the calls in parallel. For example, if you need to run \"git status\" and \"git diff\", send a single message with two tool calls to run the calls in parallel.\n\nAim for concise responses, but prioritize clarity. If fewer than 4 lines would reduce understanding, use more lines or a short bullet list.\n\nHere is useful information about the environment you are running in:\n<env>\nWorking directory: /Users/chjp007/Documents/GitHub/Agency-Code\nIs directory a git repo: True\nPlatform: Darwin\nOS Version: 24.6.0\nToday's date: 2025-09-23\nModel Name: openrouter/openai/gpt-5-mini\n</env>\n\nIMPORTANT: Always use the TodoWrite tool to plan and track tasks throughout the conversation.\n\n# Code References\n\nWhen referencing specific functions or pieces of code include the pattern `file_path:line_number` to allow the user to easily navigate to the source code location.\n\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer` function in src/services/process.ts:712.\n</example>\n", "messages": [{"content": "please make a snake game in a new folder snakegame", "role": "user", "type": "message"}, {"id": "__fake_id__", "summary": [{"text": "**Refining JavaScript Snake Game**\n\nI'm working on a JavaScript snippet for a simple snake game.

Use the instructions below and the tools available to you to assist the user.\n\nIf the user asks for help or wants to give feedback inform them of the following:\n\n- /help: Get help with using Agency Code\n- To give feedback, users should report the issue at https://github.com/VRSEN/Agency-Code/issues\n\n# Tone and style\n\nYou should be concise, direct, and to the point. When you run a non-trivial bash command, you should explain what the command does and why you are running it, to make sure the user understands what you are doing (this is especially important when you are running a command that will make changes to the user's system).\nRemember that your output will be displayed on a command line interface. Your responses can use Github-flavored markdown for formatting, and will be rendered in a monospace font using the CommonMark specification.\nOutput text to communicate with the user; all text you output outside of tool use is displayed to the user. Only use tools to complete tasks. Never use tools like Bash or code comments as means to communicate with the user during the session.\nIf you cannot or will not help the user with something, please do not say why or what it could lead to, since this comes across as preachy and annoying. Please offer helpful alternatives if possible, and otherwise keep your response to 1-2 sentences.\nOnly use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid using emojis in all communication unless asked.\nIMPORTANT: You should minimize output tokens as much as possible while maintaining helpfulness, quality, and accuracy. Only address the specific query or task at hand, avoiding tangential information unless absolutely critical for completing the request. If you can answer in 1-3 sentences or a short paragraph, please do.\nIMPORTANT: You should NOT answer with unnecessary preamble or postamble (such as explaining your code or summarizing your action), unless the user asks you to.\nIMPORTANT: Keep your responses short, since they will be displayed on a command line interface. Aim for concise responses, but prioritize clarity. If fewer than 4 lines would reduce understanding, use more lines or a short bullet list. Answer the user's question directly, without elaboration, explanation, or details. Use one-word answers only when unambiguous; otherwise include the minimal context needed for clarity. Avoid introductions, conclusions, and explanations. You MUST avoid text before/after your response, such as \"The answer is <answer>.\", \"Here is the content of the file...\" or \"Based on the information provided, the answer is...\" or \"Here is what I will do next...\". Here are some examples to demonstrate appropriate verbosity:\n<example>\nuser: 2 + 2\nassistant: 4\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: what is 2+2?\nassistant: 4\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: is 11 a prime number?\nassistant: Yes\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: what command should I run to list files in the current directory?\nassistant: ls\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: what command should I run to watch files in the current directory?\nassistant: [use the ls tool to list the files in the current directory, then read docs/commands in the relevant file to find out how to watch files]\nnpm run dev\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: How many golf balls fit inside a jetta?\nassistant: 150000\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: what files are in the directory src/?\nassistant: [runs ls and sees foo.c, bar.c, baz.c]\nuser: which file contains the implementation of foo?\nassistant: src/foo.c\n</example>\n\n# Proactiveness\n\nYou are allowed to be proactive, but only when the user asks you to do something. You should strive to strike a balance between:\n\n1. Doing the right thing when asked, including taking actions and follow-up actions\n2. Not surprising the user with actions you take without asking\n   For example, if the user asks you how to approach something, you should do your best to answer their question first, and not immediately jump into taking actions.\n3. Do not add additional code explanation summary unless requested by the user. After working on a file, just stop, rather than providing an explanation of what you did.\n\n# Following conventions\n\nWhen making changes to files, first understand the file's code conventions. Mimic code style, use existing libraries and utilities, and follow existing patterns.\n\n- NEVER assume that a given library is available, even if it is well known. Whenever you write code that uses a library or framework, first check that this codebase already uses the given library. For example, you might look at neighboring files, or check the package.json (or cargo.toml, and so on depending on the language).\n- When you create a new component, first look at existing components to see how they're written; then consider framework choice, naming conventions, typing, and other conventions.\n- When you edit a piece of code, first look at the code's surrounding context (especially its imports) to understand the code's choice of frameworks and libraries. Then consider how to make the given change in a way that is most idiomatic.\n- Always follow security best practices. Never introduce code that exposes or logs secrets and keys. Never commit secrets or keys to the repository.\n\n# Code style\n\n- IMPORTANT: DO NOT ADD **_ANY_** COMMENTS unless asked\n\n# Task Management\n\nYou have access to the TodoWrite tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\n## Planning Mode and Handoffs\n\nFor **complex tasks** that require strategic planning and task breakdown, you must handoff to the PlannerAgent. These include:\n\n- **Multi-component system architecture** (3+ interconnected systems)\n- **Large-scale refactoring** across multiple files/modules\n- **Complex feature implementation** requiring multiple phases\n- **Project planning** with dependencies and milestones\n- **Performance optimization** requiring systematic analysis\n- **Tasks requiring strategic decision-making** about technical approach\n\n**When to handoff:**\n\n- The task involves 5+ distinct steps with complex dependencies\n- Multiple architectural decisions need to be made\n- The user explicitly requests planning or strategic guidance\n- You identify the need for systematic breakdown before implementation\n\n**How to handoff:**\nUse the handoff to PlannerAgent tool when entering planning mode for extremely complex tasks.\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nuser: Run the build and fix any type errors\nassistant: I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write the following items to the todo list:\n- Run the build\n- Fix any type errors\n\nI'm now going to run the build using Bash.\n\nLooks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write 10 items to the todo list.\n\nmarking the first todo as in_progress\n\nLet me start working on the first item...\n\nThe first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...\n..\n..\n</example>\nIn the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.\n\n<example>\nuser: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats\n\nassistant: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the TodoWrite tool to plan this task.\nAdding the following todos to the todo list:\n\n1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase\n2. Design the metrics collection system\n3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality\n4. Create export functionality for different formats\n\nLet me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.\n\nI'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.\n\nI've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...\n\n[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]\n</example>\n\nUsers may configure 'hooks', shell commands that execute in response to events like tool calls, in settings. If you get blocked by a hook, determine if you can adjust your actions in response to the blocked message. If not, ask the user to check their hooks configuration.\n\n# Doing tasks\n\nThe user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more. For these tasks the following steps are recommended:\n\n- Use the TodoWrite tool to plan the task if required\n- Use the available search tools to understand the codebase and the user's query. You are encouraged to use the search tools extensively both in parallel and sequentially.\n- Implement the solution using all tools available to you\n- Verify the solution if possible with tests. NEVER assume specific test framework or test script. Check the README or search codebase to determine the testing approach.\n- VERY IMPORTANT: When you have completed a task, you MUST run the lint and typecheck commands (eg. npm run lint, npm run typecheck, ruff, etc.) with Bash if they were provided to you to ensure your code is correct. If you are unable to find the correct command, ask the user for the command to run and if they supply it, proactively suggest documenting it in AGENTS.md so that you will know to run it next time.\n  NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked, otherwise the user will feel that you are being too proactive.\n\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are NOT part of the user's provided input or the tool result.\n\n# Tool usage policy\n\n- When doing file search, prefer to use the Task tool in order to reduce context usage.\n- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. When making multiple bash tool calls, you MUST send a single message with multiple tools calls to run the calls in parallel. For example, if you need to run \"git status\" and \"git diff\", send a single message with two tool calls to run the calls in parallel.\n\nAim for concise responses, but prioritize clarity. If fewer than 4 lines would reduce understanding, use more lines or a short bullet list.\n\nHere is useful information about the environment you are running in:\n<env>\nWorking directory: /Users/chjp007/Documents/GitHub/Agency-Code\nIs directory a git repo: True\nPlatform: Darwin\nOS Version: 24.6.0\nToday's date: 2025-09-23\nModel Name: openrouter/openai/gpt-5-mini\n</env>\n\nIMPORTANT: Always use the TodoWrite tool to plan and track tasks throughout the conversation.\n\n# Code References\n\nWhen referencing specific functions or pieces of code include the pattern `file_path:line_number` to allow the user to easily navigate to the source code location.\n\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer` function in src/services/process.ts:712.\n</example>\n", "messages": [{"content": "please make a snake game in a new folder snakegame", "role": "user", "type": "message"}, {"id": "__fake_id__", "summary": [{"text": "**Refining JavaScript Snake Game**\n\nI'm working on a JavaScript snippet for a simple snake game.

When you run a non-trivial bash command, you should explain what the command does and why you are running it, to make sure the user understands what you are doing (this is especially important when you are running a command that will make changes to the user's system).\nRemember that your output will be displayed on a command line interface. Your responses can use Github-flavored markdown for formatting, and will be rendered in a monospace font using the CommonMark specification.\nOutput text to communicate with the user; all text you output outside of tool use is displayed to the user.

Aim for concise responses, but prioritize clarity. If fewer than 4 lines would reduce understanding, use more lines or a short bullet list. Answer the user's question directly, without elaboration, explanation, or details. Use one-word answers only when unambiguous; otherwise include the minimal context needed for clarity. Avoid introductions, conclusions, and explanations.

You should strive to strike a balance between:\n\n1. Doing the right thing when asked, including taking actions and follow-up actions\n2. Not surprising the user with actions you take without asking\n   For example, if the user asks you how to approach something, you should do your best to answer their question first, and not immediately jump into taking actions.\n3. Do not add additional code explanation summary unless requested by the user. After working on a file, just stop, rather than providing an explanation of what you did.\n\n# Following conventions\n\nWhen making changes to files, first understand the file's code conventions. Mimic code style, use existing libraries and utilities, and follow existing patterns.\n\n- NEVER assume that a given library is available, even if it is well known. Whenever you write code that uses a library or framework, first check that this codebase already uses the given library. For example, you might look at neighboring files, or check the package.json (or cargo.toml, and so on depending on the language).\n- When you create a new component, first look at existing components to see how they're written; then consider framework choice, naming conventions, typing, and other conventions.\n- When you edit a piece of code, first look at the code's surrounding context (especially its imports) to understand the code's choice of frameworks and libraries. Then consider how to make the given change in a way that is most idiomatic.\n- Always follow security best practices. Never introduce code that exposes or logs secrets and keys. Never commit secrets or keys to the repository.\n\n# Code style\n\n- IMPORTANT: DO NOT ADD **_ANY_** COMMENTS unless asked\n\n# Task Management\n\nYou have access to the TodoWrite tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\n## Planning Mode and Handoffs\n\nFor **complex tasks** that require strategic planning and task breakdown, you must handoff to the PlannerAgent. These include:\n\n- **Multi-component system architecture** (3+ interconnected systems)\n- **Large-scale refactoring** across multiple files/modules\n- **Complex feature implementation** requiring multiple phases\n- **Project planning** with dependencies and milestones\n- **Performance optimization** requiring systematic analysis\n- **Tasks requiring strategic decision-making** about technical approach\n\n**When to handoff:**\n\n- The task involves 5+ distinct steps with complex dependencies\n- Multiple architectural decisions need to be made\n- The user explicitly requests planning or strategic guidance\n- You identify the need for systematic breakdown before implementation\n\n**How to handoff:**\nUse the handoff to PlannerAgent tool when entering planning mode for extremely complex tasks.\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nuser: Run the build and fix any type errors\nassistant: I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write the following items to the todo list:\n- Run the build\n- Fix any type errors\n\nI'm now going to run the build using Bash.\n\nLooks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write 10 items to the todo list.\n\nmarking the first todo as in_progress\n\nLet me start working on the first item...\n\nThe first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...\n..\n..\n</example>\nIn the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.\n\n<example>\nuser: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats\n\nassistant: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the TodoWrite tool to plan this task.\nAdding the following todos to the todo list:\n\n1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase\n2. Design the metrics collection system\n3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality\n4. Create export functionality for different formats\n\nLet me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.\n\nI'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.\n\nI've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...\n\n[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]\n</example>\n\nUsers may configure 'hooks', shell commands that execute in response to events like tool calls, in settings. If you get blocked by a hook, determine if you can adjust your actions in response to the blocked message. If not, ask the user to check their hooks configuration.\n\n# Doing tasks\n\nThe user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more. For these tasks the following steps are recommended:\n\n- Use the TodoWrite tool to plan the task if required\n- Use the available search tools to understand the codebase and the user's query. You are encouraged to use the search tools extensively both in parallel and sequentially.\n- Implement the solution using all tools available to you\n- Verify the solution if possible with tests. NEVER assume specific test framework or test script. Check the README or search codebase to determine the testing approach.\n- VERY IMPORTANT: When you have completed a task, you MUST run the lint and typecheck commands (eg. npm run lint, npm run typecheck, ruff, etc.) with Bash if they were provided to you to ensure your code is correct. If you are unable to find the correct command, ask the user for the command to run and if they supply it, proactively suggest documenting it in AGENTS.md so that you will know to run it next time.\n  NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked, otherwise the user will feel that you are being too proactive.\n\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are NOT part of the user's provided input or the tool result.\n\n# Tool usage policy\n\n- When doing file search, prefer to use the Task tool in order to reduce context usage.\n- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. When making multiple bash tool calls, you MUST send a single message with multiple tools calls to run the calls in parallel. For example, if you need to run \"git status\" and \"git diff\", send a single message with two tool calls to run the calls in parallel.\n\nAim for concise responses, but prioritize clarity. If fewer than 4 lines would reduce understanding, use more lines or a short bullet list.\n\nHere is useful information about the environment you are running in:\n<env>\nWorking directory: /Users/chjp007/Documents/GitHub/Agency-Code\nIs directory a git repo: True\nPlatform: Darwin\nOS Version: 24.6.0\nToday's date: 2025-09-23\nModel Name: openrouter/openai/gpt-5-mini\n</env>\n\nIMPORTANT: Always use the TodoWrite tool to plan and track tasks throughout the conversation.\n\n# Code References\n\nWhen referencing specific functions or pieces of code include the pattern `file_path:line_number` to allow the user to easily navigate to the source code location.\n\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer` function in src/services/process.ts:712.\n</example>\n", "messages": [{"content": "please make a snake game in a new folder snakegame", "role": "user", "type": "message"}, {"id": "__fake_id__", "summary": [{"text": "**Refining JavaScript Snake Game**\n\nI'm working on a JavaScript snippet for a simple snake game.

You should strive to strike a balance between:\n\n1. Doing the right thing when asked, including taking actions and follow-up actions\n2. Not surprising the user with actions you take without asking\n   For example, if the user asks you how to approach something, you should do your best to answer their question first, and not immediately jump into taking actions.\n3. Do not add additional code explanation summary unless requested by the user. After working on a file, just stop, rather than providing an explanation of what you did.\n\n# Following conventions\n\nWhen making changes to files, first understand the file's code conventions. Mimic code style, use existing libraries and utilities, and follow existing patterns.\n\n- NEVER assume that a given library is available, even if it is well known. Whenever you write code that uses a library or framework, first check that this codebase already uses the given library. For example, you might look at neighboring files, or check the package.json (or cargo.toml, and so on depending on the language).\n- When you create a new component, first look at existing components to see how they're written; then consider framework choice, naming conventions, typing, and other conventions.\n- When you edit a piece of code, first look at the code's surrounding context (especially its imports) to understand the code's choice of frameworks and libraries. Then consider how to make the given change in a way that is most idiomatic.\n- Always follow security best practices. Never introduce code that exposes or logs secrets and keys. Never commit secrets or keys to the repository.\n\n# Code style\n\n- IMPORTANT: DO NOT ADD **_ANY_** COMMENTS unless asked\n\n# Task Management\n\nYou have access to the TodoWrite tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\n## Planning Mode and Handoffs\n\nFor **complex tasks** that require strategic planning and task breakdown, you must handoff to the PlannerAgent. These include:\n\n- **Multi-component system architecture** (3+ interconnected systems)\n- **Large-scale refactoring** across multiple files/modules\n- **Complex feature implementation** requiring multiple phases\n- **Project planning** with dependencies and milestones\n- **Performance optimization** requiring systematic analysis\n- **Tasks requiring strategic decision-making** about technical approach\n\n**When to handoff:**\n\n- The task involves 5+ distinct steps with complex dependencies\n- Multiple architectural decisions need to be made\n- The user explicitly requests planning or strategic guidance\n- You identify the need for systematic breakdown before implementation\n\n**How to handoff:**\nUse the handoff to PlannerAgent tool when entering planning mode for extremely complex tasks.\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nuser: Run the build and fix any type errors\nassistant: I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write the following items to the todo list:\n- Run the build\n- Fix any type errors\n\nI'm now going to run the build using Bash.\n\nLooks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write 10 items to the todo list.\n\nmarking the first todo as in_progress\n\nLet me start working on the first item...\n\nThe first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...\n..\n..\n</example>\nIn the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.\n\n<example>\nuser: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats\n\nassistant: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the TodoWrite tool to plan this task.\nAdding the following todos to the todo list:\n\n1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase\n2. Design the metrics collection system\n3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality\n4. Create export functionality for different formats\n\nLet me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.\n\nI'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.\n\nI've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...\n\n[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]\n</example>\n\nUsers may configure 'hooks', shell commands that execute in response to events like tool calls, in settings. If you get blocked by a hook, determine if you can adjust your actions in response to the blocked message. If not, ask the user to check their hooks configuration.\n\n# Doing tasks\n\nThe user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more. For these tasks the following steps are recommended:\n\n- Use the TodoWrite tool to plan the task if required\n- Use the available search tools to understand the codebase and the user's query. You are encouraged to use the search tools extensively both in parallel and sequentially.\n- Implement the solution using all tools available to you\n- Verify the solution if possible with tests. NEVER assume specific test framework or test script. Check the README or search codebase to determine the testing approach.\n- VERY IMPORTANT: When you have completed a task, you MUST run the lint and typecheck commands (eg. npm run lint, npm run typecheck, ruff, etc.) with Bash if they were provided to you to ensure your code is correct. If you are unable to find the correct command, ask the user for the command to run and if they supply it, proactively suggest documenting it in AGENTS.md so that you will know to run it next time.\n  NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked, otherwise the user will feel that you are being too proactive.\n\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are NOT part of the user's provided input or the tool result.\n\n# Tool usage policy\n\n- When doing file search, prefer to use the Task tool in order to reduce context usage.\n- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. When making multiple bash tool calls, you MUST send a single message with multiple tools calls to run the calls in parallel. For example, if you need to run \"git status\" and \"git diff\", send a single message with two tool calls to run the calls in parallel.\n\nAim for concise responses, but prioritize clarity. If fewer than 4 lines would reduce understanding, use more lines or a short bullet list.\n\nHere is useful information about the environment you are running in:\n<env>\nWorking directory: /Users/chjp007/Documents/GitHub/Agency-Code\nIs directory a git repo: True\nPlatform: Darwin\nOS Version: 24.6.0\nToday's date: 2025-09-23\nModel Name: openrouter/openai/gpt-5-mini\n</env>\n\nIMPORTANT: Always use the TodoWrite tool to plan and track tasks throughout the conversation.\n\n# Code References\n\nWhen referencing specific functions or pieces of code include the pattern `file_path:line_number` to allow the user to easily navigate to the source code location.\n\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer` function in src/services/process.ts:712.\n</example>\n", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "<system-reminder>\n# important-instruction-reminders\nDo what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.\nNEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.\nALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.\nNEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.\n\n# TODO List\nConsider using the TodoWrite tool to plan and track your tasks.\n\nIMPORTANT: this context may or may not be relevant to your tasks. You should not respond to this context or otherwise consider it in your response unless it is highly relevant to your task. Most of the time, it is not relevant.\n</system-reminder>"}, {"content": "please make a snake game in a new folder snakegame", "role": "user", "type": "message"}, {"id": "__fake_id__", "summary": [{"text": "**Refining JavaScript Snake Game**\n\nI'm working on a JavaScript snippet for a simple snake game.

Use the instructions below and the tools available to you to assist the user.\n\nIf the user asks for help or wants to give feedback inform them of the following:\n\n- /help: Get help with using Agency Code\n- To give feedback, users should report the issue at https://github.com/VRSEN/Agency-Code/issues\n\n# Tone and style\n\nYou should be concise, direct, and to the point. When you run a non-trivial bash command, you should explain what the command does and why you are running it, to make sure the user understands what you are doing (this is especially important when you are running a command that will make changes to the user's system).\nRemember that your output will be displayed on a command line interface. Your responses can use Github-flavored markdown for formatting, and will be rendered in a monospace font using the CommonMark specification.\nOutput text to communicate with the user; all text you output outside of tool use is displayed to the user. Only use tools to complete tasks. Never use tools like Bash or code comments as means to communicate with the user during the session.\nIf you cannot or will not help the user with something, please do not say why or what it could lead to, since this comes across as preachy and annoying. Please offer helpful alternatives if possible, and otherwise keep your response to 1-2 sentences.\nOnly use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid using emojis in all communication unless asked.\nIMPORTANT: You should minimize output tokens as much as possible while maintaining helpfulness, quality, and accuracy. Only address the specific query or task at hand, avoiding tangential information unless absolutely critical for completing the request. If you can answer in 1-3 sentences or a short paragraph, please do.\nIMPORTANT: You should NOT answer with unnecessary preamble or postamble (such as explaining your code or summarizing your action), unless the user asks you to.\nIMPORTANT: Keep your responses short, since they will be displayed on a command line interface. Aim for concise responses, but prioritize clarity. If fewer than 4 lines would reduce understanding, use more lines or a short bullet list. Answer the user's question directly, without elaboration, explanation, or details. Use one-word answers only when unambiguous; otherwise include the minimal context needed for clarity. Avoid introductions, conclusions, and explanations. You MUST avoid text before/after your response, such as \"The answer is <answer>.\", \"Here is the content of the file...\" or \"Based on the information provided, the answer is...\" or \"Here is what I will do next...\". Here are some examples to demonstrate appropriate verbosity:\n<example>\nuser: 2 + 2\nassistant: 4\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: what is 2+2?\nassistant: 4\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: is 11 a prime number?\nassistant: Yes\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: what command should I run to list files in the current directory?\nassistant: ls\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: what command should I run to watch files in the current directory?\nassistant: [use the ls tool to list the files in the current directory, then read docs/commands in the relevant file to find out how to watch files]\nnpm run dev\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: How many golf balls fit inside a jetta?\nassistant: 150000\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: what files are in the directory src/?\nassistant: [runs ls and sees foo.c, bar.c, baz.c]\nuser: which file contains the implementation of foo?\nassistant: src/foo.c\n</example>\n\n# Proactiveness\n\nYou are allowed to be proactive, but only when the user asks you to do something. You should strive to strike a balance between:\n\n1. Doing the right thing when asked, including taking actions and follow-up actions\n2. Not surprising the user with actions you take without asking\n   For example, if the user asks you how to approach something, you should do your best to answer their question first, and not immediately jump into taking actions.\n3. Do not add additional code explanation summary unless requested by the user. After working on a file, just stop, rather than providing an explanation of what you did.\n\n# Following conventions\n\nWhen making changes to files, first understand the file's code conventions. Mimic code style, use existing libraries and utilities, and follow existing patterns.\n\n- NEVER assume that a given library is available, even if it is well known. Whenever you write code that uses a library or framework, first check that this codebase already uses the given library. For example, you might look at neighboring files, or check the package.json (or cargo.toml, and so on depending on the language).\n- When you create a new component, first look at existing components to see how they're written; then consider framework choice, naming conventions, typing, and other conventions.\n- When you edit a piece of code, first look at the code's surrounding context (especially its imports) to understand the code's choice of frameworks and libraries. Then consider how to make the given change in a way that is most idiomatic.\n- Always follow security best practices. Never introduce code that exposes or logs secrets and keys. Never commit secrets or keys to the repository.\n\n# Code style\n\n- IMPORTANT: DO NOT ADD **_ANY_** COMMENTS unless asked\n\n# Task Management\n\nYou have access to the TodoWrite tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\n## Planning Mode and Handoffs\n\nFor **complex tasks** that require strategic planning and task breakdown, you must handoff to the PlannerAgent. These include:\n\n- **Multi-component system architecture** (3+ interconnected systems)\n- **Large-scale refactoring** across multiple files/modules\n- **Complex feature implementation** requiring multiple phases\n- **Project planning** with dependencies and milestones\n- **Performance optimization** requiring systematic analysis\n- **Tasks requiring strategic decision-making** about technical approach\n\n**When to handoff:**\n\n- The task involves 5+ distinct steps with complex dependencies\n- Multiple architectural decisions need to be made\n- The user explicitly requests planning or strategic guidance\n- You identify the need for systematic breakdown before implementation\n\n**How to handoff:**\nUse the handoff to PlannerAgent tool when entering planning mode for extremely complex tasks.\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nuser: Run the build and fix any type errors\nassistant: I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write the following items to the todo list:\n- Run the build\n- Fix any type errors\n\nI'm now going to run the build using Bash.\n\nLooks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write 10 items to the todo list.\n\nmarking the first todo as in_progress\n\nLet me start working on the first item...\n\nThe first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...\n..\n..\n</example>\nIn the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.\n\n<example>\nuser: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats\n\nassistant: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the TodoWrite tool to plan this task.\nAdding the following todos to the todo list:\n\n1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase\n2. Design the metrics collection system\n3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality\n4. Create export functionality for different formats\n\nLet me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.\n\nI'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.\n\nI've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...\n\n[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]\n</example>\n\nUsers may configure 'hooks', shell commands that execute in response to events like tool calls, in settings. If you get blocked by a hook, determine if you can adjust your actions in response to the blocked message. If not, ask the user to check their hooks configuration.\n\n# Doing tasks\n\nThe user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more. For these tasks the following steps are recommended:\n\n- Use the TodoWrite tool to plan the task if required\n- Use the available search tools to understand the codebase and the user's query. You are encouraged to use the search tools extensively both in parallel and sequentially.\n- Implement the solution using all tools available to you\n- Verify the solution if possible with tests. NEVER assume specific test framework or test script. Check the README or search codebase to determine the testing approach.\n- VERY IMPORTANT: When you have completed a task, you MUST run the lint and typecheck commands (eg. npm run lint, npm run typecheck, ruff, etc.) with Bash if they were provided to you to ensure your code is correct. If you are unable to find the correct command, ask the user for the command to run and if they supply it, proactively suggest documenting it in AGENTS.md so that you will know to run it next time.\n  NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked, otherwise the user will feel that you are being too proactive.\n\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are NOT part of the user's provided input or the tool result.\n\n# Tool usage policy\n\n- When doing file search, prefer to use the Task tool in order to reduce context usage.\n- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. When making multiple bash tool calls, you MUST send a single message with multiple tools calls to run the calls in parallel. For example, if you need to run \"git status\" and \"git diff\", send a single message with two tool calls to run the calls in parallel.\n\nAim for concise responses, but prioritize clarity. If fewer than 4 lines would reduce understanding, use more lines or a short bullet list.\n\nHere is useful information about the environment you are running in:\n<env>\nWorking directory: /Users/chjp007/Documents/GitHub/Agency-Code\nIs directory a git repo: True\nPlatform: Darwin\nOS Version: 24.6.0\nToday's date: 2025-09-23\nModel Name: openrouter/openai/gpt-5-mini\n</env>\n\nIMPORTANT: Always use the TodoWrite tool to plan and track tasks throughout the conversation.\n\n# Code References\n\nWhen referencing specific functions or pieces of code include the pattern `file_path:line_number` to allow the user to easily navigate to the source code location.\n\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer` function in src/services/process.ts:712.\n</example>\n", "messages": [{"content": "please make a snake game in a new folder snakegame", "role": "user", "type": "message"}, {"id": "__fake_id__", "summary": [{"text": "**Refining JavaScript Snake Game**\n\nI'm working on a JavaScript snippet for a simple snake game.
